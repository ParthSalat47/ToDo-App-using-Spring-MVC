## Salient features

> *Note: There might be some features that I didnâ€™t add to the following list because [I forgot them](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ujX6DxgaZHJXa7he7)* ðŸ¥²

1. Using this application, Tasks can be created, updated, viewed and deleted.  
2. The user can associate a task with multiple tags.  
    1. The application uses regex to separate comma-separated tags entered by the user.
3. The user can search for all tasks with a particular tag. *(Cool, isnâ€™t it?)*
4. Strict validation checks are in place, keeping in mind all possible edge cases. Robust exceptional handling has been done wherever user input is involved.
    1. For example, preventing the creation of duplicate tasks.
5. The code is clean, concise and maintainable. The UI is user-friendly. ([Iâ€™m not lying](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9AbEXxEibLLaYtGr9)Â ðŸ¤¥)

## Note for recruiters

1. [This code](https://github.com/ParthSalat47/ToDo-App-using-Spring-MVC/blob/ab380beb98eda9f4396856a71b4eef6fc38cf5d8/src/main/java/com/miscellaneous/Utility.java) was used to remove duplicates from an unsorted list of tasks. It took me a lot of time to develop this algorithm. I didnâ€™t refer anything from the internet for this, just used my problem-solving skills and DSA!

## **Screenshots**

Believe it or not, Iâ€™m as eager as you to see the screenshots of my project. When I did this project, during a 6-month internship, I forgot to take screenshots.

In order to generate the screenshots now, Iâ€™ll have to create the database again - which isÂ **very easy**, but time-consuming.

Anyways, at the end of the day, youâ€™d be judging me on myÂ **DSA and low-level design skills**. So what are we waiting for? Kindly contact me onÂ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parth-salat/)Â and schedule an interview.
